This project implements the scene recognition pipeline which is a combination of a feature representation and classifier being run on images. The two feature representation techniques that I implemented were the Tiny Images and Bag of SIFT features (more sophisticated). The two classifier techniques I explored were Nearest Neighbor and linear SVM classifiers. The classifiers and feature representations can be used in the following combinations:
1.	Tiny images representation and nearest neighbor classifier
2.	Bag of SIFT representation and nearest neighbor classifier.
3. 	Bag of SIFT representation and linear SVM classifier
